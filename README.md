# Planning

The planning process began by identifying the target clientele, which involved creating a Persona Profile using Code Institute's template based on design thinking principles. This Persona Profile helps in understanding the needs, expectations, and preferences of the identified persona, and the website is designed to cater to these specific requirements.
You can see the persona profile [HERE](README_docs/design_thinking_persona_template.pdf).

Given the prevalence of mobile usage among our target users, creating a responsive website was a top priority in our design approach. To achieve this, we leveraged the power of Bootstrap grids, elements, and responsive utilities combined with custom CSS, to ensure seamless adaptability across various devices.

### Agile Methodology

In this project Github issues were used to create the User stories and groupped into Epics, in a Github Project. This served as the Agile tool. The issues' development was managed through a Kanban board. Currently, all the issues have been marked as "Done”.

For easy access, you can find the Epics, Issues/ User Stories with their Acceptance Criteria and Kanban board [HERE](https://github.com/users/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/projects/5).

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

To support the functionality of the DownwardDog app, five models have been designed and implemented to store essential information in databases.

To showcase the relationships between the models, I have divided them into two categories: one relevant to the Articles and the other to the Booking functionality.
The Likes and User tables in the ER diagrams are for conceptual representation only and do not directly correspond to the models.py file or the physical database tables. They provide a logical view of data relationships without showing all the actual database details managed by Django and the database system.

The Entity Relationship Diagrams below illustrate how the models are connected to each other for the Articles section:

- Post and Comment have a one-to-many relationship, where one post can have multiple comments, but each comment is associated with only one post.
- User and Likes have a many-to-many relationship, where multiple users can like multiple posts, and each like is linked to both a user and a post.
- User and Post have a one-to-many relationship, where one user can be associated with multiple posts, but each post is linked to only one user (the author). This feature is however limited for the admin.

The Entity Relationship Diagrams below illustrate how the models are connected to each other for the Booking section:

- Classes and Timetable have a one-to-many relationship, where one class can have multiple timetables, but each timetable is associated with only one class.
- Timetable and Booking have a one-to-many relationship, where one timetable can have multiple bookings, but each booking is linked to only one timetable.
- Booking and User have a many-to-one relationship, where one user can create many bookings.

The unique_booking constraint in the Booking model ensures that a user can create multiple bookings, but only one booking for the same class on the same date/time.

## Bugs

The checkout_success function brake when I added the membership purchase logic to it. The error occured essentially because the profile variable was not defined in the scope of the checkout_success function when however it was called. I could resolve the problem by adding the 'profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user=request.user)' line inside the if statement, just as it was done under this for the authentication bit.
